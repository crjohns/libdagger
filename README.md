The Dagger GUI Framework

Dagger is a minimal GUI framework for games which emphasizes ease-of-use.

It doesn't have widgets or gadgets, but it does have a simple interface for creating a hierarchy of "views" inside of an outer "scene" wrapper.
Views can get input in the form of mouse and keyboard events, and they provide output through a drawing function to update their view on each frame.
